'use client'

import { X } from "lucide-react";
import Link from "next/link";

//as when we used the reset button with a reset function in the SearchForm component which is a server side component, it was showing an error as it can render a client side component that was our reset button on a server componenet. Hence to fix this we have created another client component that only exports the resetting funtionality

export default function SearchFormReset() {

    const reset = () => {
        const form = document.querySelector('.search-form') as HTMLFormElement;

        if(form) form.reset();
    }

    return (
        <button type='reset' onClick={reset}>
            <Link href="/" className="search-btn text-white">
                <X className="size-5"/>
            </Link>
            
        </button>
    )
